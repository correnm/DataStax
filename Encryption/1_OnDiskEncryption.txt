Encrypting data on disk ("data at rest" is the usual term of art) is covered by DataStax's Transparent Data Encryption
(TDE) capability.

These steps use local encryption keys. Managaing keys off-server with KMIP (Key Management Interoperability Protocol) is
also supported by DSE 5.0 but is not addressed by these instructions.
