Test 2: Replace Node
Can an orderly operational process replace a node in a cluster?

1. Add a new node
   See the instructions sent separately

2. Decommission a node
   Based on: "Removing a node": http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-admin/datastax_enterprise/operations/opsRemoveNode.html

   Assuming that the node is up. If it is not up see the instructions for a node failure / hard stop.
   nodetool -h nodeip decommission

3. Monitor decommissioning progress
    nodetool -h nodeip netstats -H

4. Shutdown node after decommissioning is complete
   service dse stop

5. Verify cluster intact
   nodetool status
   dsetool ring

6. Rebalance cluster with by running cleanup on other nodes:
   nodetool cleanup
