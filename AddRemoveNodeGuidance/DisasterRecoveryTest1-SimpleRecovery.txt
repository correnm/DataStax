Test 1: Simple Recovery
Can a single node be partitioned away from the cluster by network partitioning and later recover?

1. Shut down a node
   Since the node has not been decomissioned or otherwise removed from the cluster, the cluster will assume that it is a temporary network partitioning or disruption.

2. Write some data to the cluster
   A simple gatling test can accomplish this. The test needs to be sufficiently big to ensure that data must be written to the offline node so it should hit a number of partitions.

3. Restore the downed node
   Turn the node back on.

4. Verify the node comes up
    nodetool -h nodeip status
    dsetool ring

5. Rebalance cluster with by running cleanup on other nodes:
    nodetool cleanup
    Verify node catches up

The node should return to green in OpsCenter and show should streaming activity as data is replicated to the node.
