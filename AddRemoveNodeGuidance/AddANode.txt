Based on these instructions, which seem to have an unhelpful title: http://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-admin/datastax_enterprise/operations/opsAddNodeToCluster.html

Note the warnings that any new node must have completely bare data directories (sstables, commitlogs, saved_caches, and hints). Reinstalling on an old node could result in corrupted data.

The recommended approach is to use Terraform & Ansible for deployment. That will ensure consistency within the cluster and provide a way to track changes. These instructions are provided as an example of how a manually managed cluster would work.



The basic process to build out a node is:
  1. Install DSE, but do not start it.
  2. Update the cassandra.yaml file based on the instructions below (and possibly also the cassandra-rackdc.properties file).
  3. Start the node with: service dse start
  4. Verify node status with 'nodetool -h x.y.z.??? status'. Look for status result of UN for Up/Normal


The cassandra-rackdc.properties may need to be updated. Best to just copy an existing one from the other nodes.

Here's the changes to make to the cassandra.yaml file. These are the target values:

    cluster_name: 'YOUR CLUSTER NAME HERE'
    listen_address: x.y.z.???
    broadcast_rpc_address: x.y.z.???
    num_tokens: 128
    allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor: 3
    seed_provider:
        - class_name: org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSeedProvider
          parameters:
          - seeds: "x.y.z.?,x.y.z.?"

Notes:
  + The instructions mention an auto_bootstrap value, which is not in the cassandra.yaml file. It is true by default so I see no need to add it.
  + Verify the num_tokens value. If you are running Solr, then it should be lower, 16 or 32.
  + The allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor is commented out by default in the config. Uncomment it and set the value to 3.
