iConfiguring Authorization
http://docs.datastax.com/en/latest-dse/datastax_enterprise/unifiedAuth/configAuthorize.html

Note: These instructions presume that the cluster has already been successfully configured for Authentication. 


1. In cassandra.yaml file, verify authorizer is: com.datastax.bdp.cassandra.auth.DseAuthorizer

    authorizer: com.datastax.bdp.cassandra.auth.DseAuthorizer
    
    
2. Set authorization option in dse.yaml file: 

  
      * Change from: 

        authorization_options: 
            enabled: false

      * Change to: 

        authorization_options: 
            enabled: true

    Note that transitional_mode can be disabled because this is a new cluster.
    

3. Verify authentication schemes have been enabled in dse.yaml


    * Verify 
    
        authentication_options:
            enabled: true
            default_scheme: internal
            other_schemes:
            scheme_permissions: false
            allow_digest_with_kerberos: false
            plain_text_without_ssl: warn
            transitional_mode: disabled
            

Note: steps 4 - 6 in the linked instructions above apply to the use of `scheme_permissions`. Since G2 Ops is only using Internal authentication, `scheme_permissions` does not apply
